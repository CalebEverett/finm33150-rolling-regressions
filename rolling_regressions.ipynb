    "In this assignment we calculate regression coefficients for daily returns of 210 individual equities versus the market derived from exponentially weighted and boxcar widows of various lengths and compare them to coefficients calculated from a forward boxcar window. Our basis for comparison is that the coefficients calculated from the forward boxcar windows are the \"correct\" coefficients and we therefore endeavor to determine which set of historical coefficients are most similar. To determine similarity we perform the following analyses across window methodology and length.\n",
